Today's puzzle was pretty simple, a great start to the year. The leaderboard, as always, was super competitive, with it filling up after just 2 minutes and 31 seconds after posting. Wow!

## Input

Today's input is a list of [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple). Each tuple contains two integers, representing a "location ID."

Example:

```
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
```

To parse the input, I simply went over each line and added each item to a separate list:

```js
const list1 = [];
const list2 = [];
const lines = input.split('\n');
for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; ++i) {
	const items = lines[i].split('   '); // there are three spaces between numbers
	list1.push(Number(items[0]));
	list2.push(Number(items[1]));
}
```

In my actual solution, I took a slightly different approach to writing this:

```js
const pairs = input.split('\n').map((line) => {
	// map each line to a tuple (ex: [3, 4])
	return line.split(/\s+/g).map(Number);
});

// map the pairs to lists
const list1 = pairs.map(([v]) => v);
const list2 = pairs.map(([_, v]) => v);
```

## Part 1

Our goal is to pair up the smallest number on the left list with the smallest number on the right list, and then do the same for the second-smallest number in each list, until we've paired them all up.

`n` will refer to the number of items in a list.

### Approaches

**ðŸ’¡ Loop over the input `n` times.**

Each iteration, we find the smallest in each list, and then remove them from the list/disqualify them in future iterations.

<summary>Explanation</summary>

The basic idea for finding the smallest would be as follows:

```js
// do this for each list
let smallest = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; ++i) {
	if (list[i] < smallest) {
		smallest = list[i];
	}
}
```

alternatively

```js
let smallest = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; ++i) {
	smallest = Math.min(list[i], smallest);
}
```

or even

```js
const smallest = Math.min(...list);
```

From here, you'd take each list's smallest, get the distance between them, and then remove them from each list so they aren't used again.

This approach would be fairly slow, and I fear that part 2's goal wouldn't nicely extend from this approach.
